# About-Me

Welcome to my README.md File!

In this file you will see an explanation of my website followed with a screeshot and link.

For my website, I had designed a layout for the user to look at which section of the website they like. The nav bar at the top will direct to a part of the website. It involved a paragraph about who I am with an input section on how they can contact me for future enquiries. I also have a section at the bottom with picture on which can transition the opacity when hovering over it while also having a caption on the bigger picture.
